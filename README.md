# User Workspace

## Project Overview
The **User Workspace** is a backend API for a Stock Broker application built using Node.js and Express. It provides endpoints for user authentication and market trading functionalities. The API is designed to be robust, scalable, and easily extensible.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd user-workspace
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Ensure you have a database set up and configured in your `./models/user.js`.

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can start the server using:
```bash
node index.js
```
The server will run on port **3000** or any other port specified in the environment variable `PORT`.

Access the API at `http://localhost:3000/`. You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the endpoints.
